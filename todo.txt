-Figure out why in the fuck there's a gap widening for every time
I press the buttons, even if I don't write anything.

Solution: every time I clicked on something it was added to the UL
element even if I didnt submit anything. Solution, add a length
property to the textField value that has to be truthy.

------------------------------

-Figure out why when I press on another button, the class is added
to it but when I submit text, it's still added to the UL beneath the
first button I pressed.

Answer: because while the addEventListener resets when I submit the
form, it doesnt reset if I don't submit the form.

Possible solution; add an if check before the forms eventlistener
which checks if the form has actually been submitted or not, and if
it hasnt, then just don't do anything.

Question now is how to do that, I've tried adding a function that
can only be accessed when the form is submitted.

Seems like I've executed it..The submit listener only comes up after
I submit something, but the text is still added into the UL under
the button I clicked.
