-Finish this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofux_4c94FI
-Test and refine my code until it works, I guess?
-Figure out how to format the array of messages. Look into this:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat#instance_properties
Maybe watch or read about array methods as well.
Maybe create a loop where each element in the array is formatted individually.
Look at this as well: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp
-Find an array method or something that will add just the last thing
added to the array rather than the entire array with the real time
updates.

First: Figure out how to format it properly.
Second: Make it add only one at a time.
Solution, look through the chatroom project again until I understand
better how to render stuff in a database to the UI.
Got it, need to just format it properly now, will use CSS for that mainly.
Also need to use a created at property to sort the documents with so
they're rendered in the correct order.
Also need to do so I can add to the UI based on the index property of
the document. That means I have to set the index property equal to a
variable that is equal to the index of each individual index property.
Maybe try to use e.target to get the id attribute of the button that
is pressed on.

Do next: Restructure it somehow. Write it in the architecture file.
